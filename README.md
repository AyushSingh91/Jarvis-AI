# Jarvis-AI
Jarvis AI is a voice-activated virtual assistant built using Python that can perform a wide range of tasks just like the fictional AI from the Iron Man movies. This project showcases how Python can be used to integrate speech recognition, text-to-speech, and automation features to create an intelligent assistant.
